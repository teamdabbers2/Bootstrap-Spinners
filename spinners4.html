<!--We can even change the size of the spinner by adding sm after the spinner-grow/spinner-border like
spinner-border-sm. We have to add this after spinner-grow or spinner-border. Don't delete the original spinner-grow/spinner-border. Also
keep in mind that large wont work and if you want to make it bigger you have to manually add size dimensions within the spinner-border/spinner-grow
